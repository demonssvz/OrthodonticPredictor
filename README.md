## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the app locally, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the application in your default web browser where you can interact with the model and make predictions based on input data.

## Usage
1. Upload your pretreatment images or enter data as required by the app.
2. The app will process the data and predict the P-value related to the orthodontic treatment.
3. You can view the predictions and interact with the model via the Streamlit interface.
